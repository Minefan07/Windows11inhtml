I have never made such a big project in HTML before! I am simply doing this as a hobby. This thing originated as me just trying to make the most accurate clone of Windows 11 in HTML, JS, and CSS. But now it has become a fun thing to do when I can! so please help contrbute to it by committing and making it better. Thanks in advance!
